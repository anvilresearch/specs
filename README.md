# Specs
This repo contains specifications, extensions and proposals for OpenID Connect,
authentication and other related topics.

For actual documentation on how to use the [Anvil Connect OIDC
Server](https://github.com/anvilresearch/connect) and related libraries,
see the **[Anvil Connect Docs](https://github.com/anvilresearch/connect-docs)**
repo.

## Proposal Process
If you wish to propose a substantial addition to Anvil Connect, use the
following process (loosely inspired by the [Ember.js RFC
Process](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs), which itself was inspired by the
Rust RFC Process):

1. Submit a PR with proposal document (in `.md`/GitHub Markdown format) in this
  repo's `/proposals` directory.
2. Try to include the following sections in your proposal, when applicable:
  * **Summary**: One paragraph explanation of the feature.
  * **Motivation**: What's the motivation for this proposal? What use cases does
    it support? What is the expected outcome?
  * **Terminology**: What names and terminology work best for these concepts and
  why? How is this idea best presented?
  * **Design**: The bulk of the proposal, a detailed design or specification.
  * **Drawbacks**: Are there reasons *not* to implement this proposal? Identify
    potential tradeoffs.
  * **Alternatives**: What other designs/alternatives have been considered?
3. In the comments on the PR, answer questions, build consensus, and integrate
  feedback. Multiple iterations of the PR are totally ok, and encouraged.

Note: The acceptance and merging of the PR is not a commitment by the Anvil
Research team to implement this proposal. It is a sign, however, that we would
at least be open to the idea, and agree to the general principles and motivation
in the proposal.
